          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
        <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich. For the first half of its life, JavaScript was mainly used to add
          interactivity to web page, and was disparaged as a programming language. In modern times however, it is extremely
          widespread, and even entirely possible to write JavaScript for use on servers, natively on your computer, and is
          even used in production for smart phone applications.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language (which means that it is turned into machine-readable code at run-time instead
          of being compiled ahead of time). It is still mainly used on the web, however, JavaScript has evolved far beyond
          front-end, and just sprinkling into webpages for interactivity.</p>
        <p>In the following documentation we will go over why JavaScript is a great language to learn, some of the basic syntax,
          and how to move forward with your learning if you decide to go down the JavaScript route.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Why_Learn_JavaScript">
        <header>
          <h2>Why Learn JavaScript</h2>
        </header>
        <p>JavaScript is a great first language for people learning to program. Many people will argue that it has pitfalls
          (it does), that it can form bad habits (it can), and that there are a lot of high-level abstractions within the
          language that allow people to take important things for granted (it does).</p>
        <h3>So why learn JavaScript? Especially as a first language?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is a huge community who can help you when you get stuck</li>
          <li>The syntax is extremely close to many other languages (which makes it easier to learn other languages later)</li>
          <li>It is extremely flexible to many different programming paradigms</li>
          <li>It runs everywhere!</li>
          <li>You can start applying skills instantly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the sound of that interests you, move on to the next section to start learning some of the basics. These docs
          are not exhaustive, and will give you only a taste of some of the basic language features</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>
          <h2>Variables</h2>
        </header>
        <p>If you have gone through math, you should be familiar with a variable.</p>
        <p>A variable is a symbol that represents a value.</p>
        <p>This value can be known, or unknown, and can change or be constant. The name variable can make it hard for people
          to grasp how something can be constant. To explain this, let's think about pi. Pi is a symbol that represents a
          number. The number 3.14... doesn't change. It is constant. But it is represented with the variable symbol pi.</p>
        <p>There are a few things we can do with variables in JavaScript:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Declare them</li>
          <li>Assign a value to them</li>
          <li>Change their value (as long as the variable is not a constant)</li>
          <li>Use their value</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
        <p>There are three keywords you can use to declare a variable in JavaScript:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>var</li>
          <li>let</li>
          <li>const</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"var" is the traditional way of declaring a variable. For many years it was the only way. However, it carries with
          it some baggage that can make your code run in unexpected ways. You should recognize it in code used by others,
          but avoid using it while writing your own until you learn the intracacies that come along with using it, and then
          you should only use it when you have a good reason to.</p>
        <p>The value of a "var" variable can be changed, so it is not a constant</p>
        <p>"let" is similar to "var", in that it is not constant, and can be reassigned. However, let is a more modern way to
          declare variables, and avoids the pitfalls that "var" has. If you are making a variable whose value will need to
          change then you should use let.</p>
        <p>"const" is...you guessed it... a constant! This can be hard to wrap your head around. Why would you want a value
          to stay the same? There are obvious examples like pi, or the answer to the universe (42). But instead think of
          constants as a slice of time. The value can be different every time a program runs, or later when we learn about
          functions, and be changed by the input given to a function. The formula for calulating the circumference of a circle
          is 2Ï€r. The formula is constant, but value of r (radius) changes based on the circle. The rule of thumb is that
          you should always use const unless you need to reassign the value, and then you should use let.</p>

        <p>Declaring variables with all three types looks like: </p>
        <code>
        var favoriteFood;
        let favoriteColor;
        const favoritePerson;
        </code>
        <p>Note on declaring const. You would actually want to declare a const with a value, because otherwise it will be assigned
          the value of undefined, and you won't be allowed to change it because, well, it's constant!</p>

        <h3>Assigning Values to Variables</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is cool because anything can be assigned to a variable. Strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and even functions.
          Assigning a value to a variables is easy! You can even declare a variable, with a value all in one line.</p>
        <code>
        let favoriteFood = "pizza";
        const favoriteNumber = 42;
        </code>
        <h2>Changing an assigned value</h2>
        <p>If you declared a variable with let, then you can reassign a variable like:</p>
        <code>
        let favoriteFood = "pizza";
        favoriteFood = "hamburgers";
        </code>
        <h3>Using a variable's value</h3>
        <p>Using a variable's value is as easy as using it's name.</p>
        <code>
        let number = 10;
        let otherNumber = 20;
        let otherOtherNumber = number + otherNumber;
        </code>
        <p>Can you guess what otherOtherNumber's value is? (I'll give you a hint, it's number plus otherNumber)... you're right.
          It's 30.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Structures">
        <header>
          <h2>Data Structures</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I don't want to get bogged down in the details, but in JavaScript, there are two basic datastructures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrays</li>
          <li>Objects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>An array is an indexed list of things. It can be pretty much anything. Strings, numbers, objects, booleans, even
          other arrays. Being indexed just means that it is ordered, and you can access elements in the array with the item's
          index.
        </p>
        <p>The only caveat is that the index starts at 0. This is a computer science thing, and arrays (not always called arrays
          in other languages) almost always start at 0.</p>
        <p>An array looks like:</p>
        <code>let exampleArray = [ "cool", 2, true ];</code>
        <p>To access an element within an array you use what is called "bracket notation". You use the variable name of the
          array, followed by a pair of brackets, and inside those brackets, you put the index number of the item you would
          like. For example to get the value 2, out of exampleArray:</p>
        <code>let num2 = exampleArray[1] // => 2</code>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>Objects are a structure with key value pairs. A key is like a variable, and a value can be anything, an array, string,
          number, another object, a function (a function inside of an object or on an object is called a method in JavaScript).
          You use curly braces "{" and "}" to define an object literal. You call these key value pairs "properties".</p>
        <code>
            let obj = {
              favoriteNumber: 42,
              favoriteColor: 'red',
              cool: true,
            }
        </code>
        <p>To access elements from an object you can use either the dot notation, or bracket notation. If you know the property
          you are accessing use dot notation.</p>
        <p>Dot notation</p>
        <code>
        obj.favoriteNumber // => 42
        </code>
        <p>Bracket notation</p>
        <code>
        obj['favoriteColor'] // => 'red'
        let keyIWant = 'cool'
        obj[keyIwant] // => true
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>
          <h2>Functions</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Functions are a fundamental part of any programming language. Once again, there is a lot of small details to bogged
          down by with functions in JavaScript, so we are just goint to stick to the basics. There is much more to learn
          about functions that what is contained in this small little doc.</p>
        <p>A function is an algorithm that you define for the computer to run. I'm sorry, that's a terrible definition, but
          it will be easier to understand than it sounds. I will present some opinions on functions that I think makes programming,
          and learning to program much easier. Not everyone shares these same opinions.</p>
        <p>Let's show an example of a simple function definition, and disect it's parts</p>
        <code> 
          function helloWorld (greeting, name) {
            return greeting + " " + name;
          }
        </code>
        <p>First: the function keyword. You declare a function by using the word function, followed by the name you want to
          give the function. We chose helloWorld. </p>
        <p>Second the words greeting, and name inside of the parenthesis... those are called parameters. Think of them as variables
          that are place holders for values you are going to give the function later. They are specific to the function.
          Opinion: you should only use values that are explicity passed into a function (what this really means is do not
          rely on global data).</p>
        <p>The curly braces are called the function block. This creates a local scope for the function to run in isolation.
          Inside of the curly braces is the body of the function.</p>
        <p>The return keyword is a reserved keyword that tells the function what value should be given as a result of the function
          running.
        </p>

        <p>To use the function later in the program we might do something like:</p>
        <code>helloWorld('Hey there', 'Todd') // => 'Hey there Todd'</code>
        <p>We call the function by using its name
          <underline>helloWorld</underline>.</p>
        <p>We pass it arguments that correspond with the parameters it expects in the function definition. Those are 1. greeting,
          and 2. name. It's important to note that JavaScript is not strongly typed, and we can actually pass any value for
          either argument. There is nothing stopping us from passing 2, and false, as the arguments. This is why supersets
          of JavaScript like TypeScript (created by Microsoft) exist. It allows us to declare the type of arguments that
          we expect, and the type of return we expect, so that we can have been error handling before introducing bugs into
          our code.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Modern_EcmaScript">
        <header>
          <h2>Modern EcmaScript</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The JavaScript that is used today is actually more accurately called EcmaScript. It is being actively developed by
          TC39, which is a board of representatives from technology compaines (Google, Microsoft, PayPal, and many others).</p>
        <p>Many new features in EcmaScript take a while for browsers to implement. But the goal of TC39 is to make it easier
          for all browsers to implement these new features in a standard way, so that JavaScript executes in the ways that
          we expect.</p>
        <p>To use these new features sooner, rather than later, you will have to utilize build tools. I mentioned one earlier,
          TypeScript, but there is also Babel.</p>
        <p>TypeScript and Babel are not necessarily direct competitors. You can infact use both together, and people do. But
          TypeScript also gives you typesafety, and depending on the editor you use, intellisense (code completion, and definitions
          as you're typing) and it also will transpile modern EcmaScript, down to a version of JavaScript that is compatible
          with the minimum browser you would like to target. Babel strictly gives you the ability to transpile modern EcmaScript
          to usable JavaScript.</p>
